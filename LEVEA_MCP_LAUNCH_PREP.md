### Subreddit-Specific Copy & Tool Payload

```json
{
  "platform": "reddit",
  "subreddits": ["mcp", "ClaudeAI", "sideproject"],
  "post_type": "link_text",
  "title": "Show Reddit: Levea — Prompt-First AI Video Editor over MCP (Auto Captions, B-Roll, Motion Graphics)",
  "url": "https://smithery.ai/servers/brajendrak00068/levea-ai-video-editor",
  "body": "Hi r/mcp and fellow builders,\n\nWe just launched **Levea AI Video Editor** as a fully standardized MCP server!\n\n### What is Levea?\nInstead of spending hours manually trimming, aligning captions, and keyframing motion graphics on a traditional timeline, Levea lets you describe your creative goal in plain language: \n\n*\"Generate a viral vertical clip, add word-by-word bold captions, remove silences, track my face, add B-roll and motion graphics, and export for TikTok and Reels.\"*\n\nBehind the scenes, Levea parses your prompt into typed intents, compiles them into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), executes them through safety gates, and exports a high-performance MP4.\n\n### Core Capabilities Included:\n- **Vertical Reframing & Silence Cuts**\n- **Auto Captions** (40+ styles with word-by-word active animation)\n- **Motion Graphics** (Verified HyperFrames and Remotion compositions like social cards, lower thirds, and callouts)\n- **AI B-Roll, Voiceovers & Music** (Google Cloud TTS + AI reference matching)\n- **Multi-Platform Export** (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Reels, 9:16 vertical bundles)\n\n### How to Run it:\nYou can connect Levea to your favorite MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, or OpenClaw) instantly:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"levea\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"levea-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"LEVEA_API_URL\": \"https://api.livecore.ai\",\n        \"LEVEA_API_KEY\": \"your-levea-api-key\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*(Generate your API key for free at https://studio.livecore.ai/)*\n\nWould love to hear your feedback, especially around how our Workflow DAG handle-flow matches your agent workflows!"

## 2. Hacker News (HN) Payload (`Show HN`)
*Optimized for a highly technical developer audience who appreciate clean, deterministic compile pipelines.*

```json
{
  "platform": "hackernews",
  "title": "Show HN: Levea — Prompt-to-Video editor powered by deterministic Workflow DAGs",
  "url": "https://github.com/brajendrak00068/agentic-ai-video-production",
  "text": "Hi HN,\n\nWe built Levea because we were frustrated with how standard AI video tools work. Most of them use loose LLM loops that hallucinate edits, drop layers, or mess up frame alignments. \n\nLevea takes a different approach: **Prompt → LLM emits typed Intermediate Representation (IR) → Deterministic compiler expands to a Workflow DAG → Gated executor mutates Vulkan-accelerated scene → Automated verification and repairs.**\n\nWe’ve just open-sourced our client-side Model Context Protocol (MCP) server wrapper (`levea-mcp-server`) and launched our core server bundle on Smithery (https://smithery.ai/servers/brajendrak00068/levea-ai-video-editor).\n\n### Technical Highlights:\n1. **Deterministic Orchestration:** We use LLMs solely for metadata parsing and parameters resolution. The actual timeline edits (trimming, alignment, caption generation, speed ramps, and HyperFrames/Remotion motion-graphics materialization) are executed strictly via our deterministic compiler.\n2. **Rich Aesthetics & Performance:** Built with native C++/Vulkan acceleration on the rendering side, supporting full cinematic SDF text layouts, high-end motion graphics overlays, and smart frame-by-frame parallel rendering.\n3. **MCP Stdio Protocol:** Runs entirely locally via `npx -y levea-mcp-server` over stdio and links directly to Cursor, Cline, or Claude Code.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts on the compilation pipeline and how we balance LLM interpretation with deterministic rendering!"
